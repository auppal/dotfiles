# Work around all sorts of bugs.
# 1. Use stuff a space and writebuf instead of just stuffing > in copy mode because
# screen gets mixed up between copy-mode bindings and windowlist bindings, and refuses
# to execute a switch windows when return is typed.
# 2. Use osc52 instead of xclip even when $DISPLAY is set becuase xclip is subject to
# timing problems when the shell exits quickly.
# 3. Stuff a literal carriage return at the end so that ^M continues to work inside command mode.
